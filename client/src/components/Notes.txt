Notes on how the components work.

Will need to refactor for better understanding



<App>
  <Routing>
    <Header>
    <RoutingRoutes>
      <Board> ----- homepage; showing all posts
        <PostListing> --- useEffect API GET request to ./comments
                          fetches all posts
                          with {rootId:null} - no root ID 
                          means the object is a post, instead of comment
                          each post onClick will link to <CommentModal>
      <CommentModal> --- opens specific post on homepage with specific ID /comment/:id
                         same as <CommentPage>, except in a modal form
                         useEffect to GET specific comment ./comment/:id
                         pass specific comment to <Comment>
        <Comment> --- useEffect to fetch all comments for a post
                      GET request to ./comments/root/:id
          <Post> ---- the specific post itself
          <CommentForm> --- add a comment
          <Comments> ---- useContext to provide the refreshComment function
                          you have parentId and rootId
                          you have all the comments for this rootId from <Comment>
                          this level you filter comments for same parentId
            <Comments> ---- recursion here, were we nest the same component <Comments>
                            this time the parentId, instead of passing the postID
                            we pass the ID of the parent comment


      <CommentPage>

        <Comment>
                         

      <CommentPage> ---- specific post page
    <PostFormModal> --- create a post
    <AuthModal> --- login/register


## Comment and Threading
Uses same modal as a post
Attributes are:
Author 
Body - comment content/post content
ParentId - refers to parent comment
RootId - refers to the post

When a page loads
